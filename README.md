## MessageBlake

The demo vision currently consists of Analysts (3), Supervisor (1), Executive (1) and an Admin / Facilitator (1). The general workflow begins with a report created by an Analyst based on data sources made available to them. This report collects a variety of metadata and is passed up the chain to the Supervisor and the Executive. The onus is on the Supervisor to collect the reports from the Analysts and aggregate into a communication for the Executive. The novelty of the application will allow users to know where the information was originally sourced from, who contributed it, the level of confidence associated with it etc. and this will manifest itself in the Executive view.

For the purposes of the demo, the expectation is for most of the data to be initialized to allow the facilitaors to guide the users through scenarios to demonstrate the capabilities and value of the application.
